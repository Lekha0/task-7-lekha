# 🚢 Task 7: Logistic Regression – Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Internship: AI & ML Internship

**Task Name:** Logistic Regression – Titanic Survival Prediction
**Dataset:** Titanic Dataset (Seaborn / Kaggle)
**Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
**Language:** Python

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to build a **binary classification model** using **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger details.

This task focuses on:

* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training
* Proper performance evaluation

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **Dataset Name:** Titanic Dataset
* **Target Column:** `survived`

  * `0` → Did Not Survive
  * `1` → Survived

### Important Features Used:

* `pclass` – Passenger class
* `sex` – Gender
* `age` – Age of passenger
* `fare` – Ticket fare
* `embarked` – Port of embarkation

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. Loaded the Titanic dataset
2. Selected relevant features and removed unnecessary columns
3. Handled missing values using:

   * Median (Age)
   * Mode (Embarked)
4. Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**
5. Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**
6. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
7. Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
8. Generated predictions on test data
9. Evaluated the model using:

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
   * F1-score
   * Confusion Matrix
   * ROC Curve and AUC Score

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics Explained

* **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the model
* **Precision:** Correct positive predictions out of all predicted positives
* **Recall:** Correctly identified survivors out of all actual survivors
* **F1-Score:** Balance between precision and recall
* **ROC Curve:** Performance of model at different thresholds
* **AUC:** Overall ability of the model to distinguish between classes

---



## ✅ Final Outcome

* Built a binary classification model
* Applied proper preprocessing techniques
* Evaluated model performance using multiple metrics
* Understood Logistic Regression and ROC–AUC analysis

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience with **Logistic Regression**, **data preprocessing**, and **performance evaluation**, which are essential skills for real-world machine learning applications.
